## Neural Machine Translation with Attention

In this project I used an encoder-decoder model with Luong attention to translate French sentences to English.

The model can translate well if he has already seen the words in the sentence, but the translation can be terrible if you use a lot of words that are not in the vocabulary of the dataset.
